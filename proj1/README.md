Method of solution  related to Problem

The solution we found is to develop a specific platform like a web portal which helps to enhance the bridge between service person and customer.
Previously, each company dealer has its own business platform, instead, we made a platform wherein it brings all the dealers to a single platform.
Usability:

This portal is user-friendly.
Provides with the best services anywhere as per the customer requirement.
One platform where a customer will have to choose the dealer from a given list.
Database Connectivity:

Itâ€™s a cinch to connect to a database with MySQL.

Admin
Dealer
Booking

Conclusion:

It also reduces manpower.
Thereby increasing the economy of the system in the future, such kind of systems are increasing in demand.

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
